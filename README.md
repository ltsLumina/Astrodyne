# Astrodyne
 A new personal project that takes inspiration from BenBonk's Slimekeep.
  > An action rogue-like with themes and mechanics influenced by Final Fantasy XIV's Astrologian and combat from rogue-likes such as Cult of the Lamb.

## Game Design
 
#### Character:
The player will be a desciple of the grim reaper who has the ability to draw the souls of his enemies, and then use them to recieve buffs, or alternatively use as a weapon to attack waves of randomly spawning enemies.

#### Mechanic
To be able to harvest upgrades, AKA "Souls", the player must use their scythe as a melee weapon. This adds a hint of risk to getting stronger, rather than relying on your ranged weapons or abilities.

#### World: 
The world will be comprised of smaller, individual rooms that lock behind when you enter, similar to Binding of Isaac. Once you enter you must kill the enemies that are inside, of which some rooms will spawn in enemies in waves. Once a room is cleared the player has a chance to be rewarded a upgrade card.

# Planned Features:
* astrologian type card draws
* pick a rogue-like buff from 3 different cards
* consume card (passive buff) or throw card at enemy (active attack)
* astrodyne from FFXIV (3 random buffs slowly cycle, different effects depending on how many you have)
