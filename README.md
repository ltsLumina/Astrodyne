# Astrodyne
 A new personal project that takes inspiration from BenBonk's Slimekeep.
  > An action rogue-like with themes and mechanics influenced by Final Fantasy XIV's Astrologian and combat from rogue-likes such as Cult of the Lamb.

## Game Design
 
#### Character:
The player will be an [undecided] character who has the ability to draw magical cards that they can recieve buffs from, or alternatively use as a weapon to attack randomly spawning enemies.

#### World: 
The world will be comprised of smaller, individual rooms that lock behind when you enter, similar to Binding of Isaac. Once you enter you must kill the enemies that are inside, of which some rooms will spawn in enemies in waves. Once a room is cleared the player has a chance to be rewarded a upgrade card.

# Planned Features:
* astrologian type card draws
* pick a rogue-like buff from 3 different cards
* consume card (passive buff) or throw card at enemy (active attack)
* astrodyne from FFXIV (3 random buffs slowly cycle, different effects depending on how many you have)
