# Astrodyne
 A new personal project that takes inspiration from BenBonk's Slimekeep.
  > An action rogue-like with themes and mechanics influenced by Final Fantasy XIV's Astrologian and combat from rogue-likes such as Cult of the Lamb.

## Game Design
 
#### Character:
The player will be an [undecided] character who has the ability to draw magical cards that they can recieve buffs from, or alternatively use as a weapon to attack randomly spawning enemies.

#### World: 
At the time of writing, I am contemplating what kind of level system the world should consist of. Either in the shape of rooms with a fog-of-war system, shrouding the forthcoming enemies, or a more open world-esque design philosophy.

# Planned Features:
* astrologian type card draws
* pick a rogue-like buff from 3 different cards
* consume card (passive buff) or throw card at enemy (active attack)
* astrodyne from FFXIV (3 random buffs slowly cycle, different effects depending on how many you have)
